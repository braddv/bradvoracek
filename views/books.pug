		p.lead The Nix created American characters I felt deeply invested in. A mother and son with a terrible relationship. A fat and poor MMO addict. A college student who has no idea why she is there. Nathan Hill draws beautiful parallels between the 1968 protests in Chicago to the Occupy Wall Street movement in 2010. This served as a reminder for me that the Civil Rights Movement is still ongoing. The book felt very timely. He comments on the political and economic situation America finds itself in in 2016, and shows how this position plays out in the life of fictional but totally believable characters. It contains longwinded vignettes that remind me of David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest. I meet so many people whose thoughts really work like that. They talk and think in long winded sentences that really have no purpose being long winded sentences but for some reason they turn out like that because they can not simply take the time to notice that the one thing they are doing automatically all the time has changed so much and because it has been going on like that for some time they do not even realize how different it is from their resting state. Simply breathing is shown as a solution for our lack of empathy. He shows how the anxiety, depression, and feelings of isolation and loneliness felt by some Americans are connected to the capitalist system they all live in. The college girl sheds some light on how I felt in both schools I attended. This feeling that we had no clue why we were there but somehow it was <i>deeply important</i>. The commentary surrounding college strongly reminded me of William Deresiewicz' Excellent Sheep. Overall, I highly recommend this book. You'll learn something about American society, and perhaps something about yourself. 
		blockquote Maybe literally the last thing you should be doing right now is thinking. The very worst thing you could be doing right now is examining the situation and trying to decide what is <i>right</i>.... Listen, Samuel, really, voice of experience here? It's a terrible burden being idealistic. It discolors everything you'll do later. It will haunt you constantly for all time as you become the inevitably cynical person the world requires you to be. Just give up on it now, the idealism, doing the right thing. Then you'll have nothing to regret later.

		p.lead Excellent Sheep got me through my master's degree. It was my 6th year of college. I finished Berkeley, almost getting a double major, but realizing somewhere in my junior year that I really didn't care about getting both majors. I was learning less by taking so many technical classes. They overlapped so much. My goal in many classes turned into minimizing workload required to pass. I took it too far in my final math class, trying to get a D to cement my double major status, and I ended up with a big fat F, so I "only" got a math minor. I wish someone told me not to double major. I wish someone told me to take classes I was interested in. I wish someone told me not to have so much grit. Eventually someone did, but I didn't read William until I finished two more brutal years of grad school. Some of the classes in grad school were great. Those that required me to read and write. I still had to take so much math though, that my goal became the same. Do the least amount of work to pass the class. I thought I had better things to do than work my ass off on material I already knew. And perhaps I did. I made good friends. I read a lot of tangential material. I thought a lot about the college system. In the end I learned a lot. But that won't be reflected in my grades. That's ok, because I think they're a bullshit measure of intelligence anyway. You'll have to decide for yourself.

		p.lead While I was supposed to be learning about money in one of my economics classes from a syllabus with 100 articles that 'required' us to read half a dozen and we could pass the class with reading none, I managed to fit in Graeber's book on the history of debt relations. Randall Wray was one of my teachers and presented us the so called chartalist interpretation of money, where money is a creature of the state. Graeber takes this interpretation and backs it up with how money and debt have been used for the past 5000 years. He brings in the question of the morality of money. The relationship between the state and markets. He debunks 'the myth of barter.' He talks of things like Debt Jubilee's and not paying back debts, which get blank stares if you bring them up to most people. Surely all debts (on balance sheets) have to be paid? This book will get you thinking about money in a way you likely haven't before, and that's important. We should be talking about our money system. It's one we all have to participate in. It should be working for all of us. Lately, and perhaps since its inception, it seems like that isn't the case. 
		blockquote What is a debt, anyway? A debt is just the perversion of a promise. It is a promise corrupted by both math and violence. If freedom (real freedom) is the ability to make friends, then it is also, necessarily, the ability to make real promises. What sorts of promises might genuinely free men and women make to one another? At this point we can't even say. It's more a question of how we can get to a place that will allow us to  find out.

		p.lead Anwar Shaikh presents Capitalism as a reconstruction of political economy. He brings analysis of the economy back to its roots. I'm slowly working my way through this behemoth, but it seems like he has struck gold. He too debunks many economic theories that dominate discourse in the American Economics 101 curriculum. Rather than throwing out economic analysis completely though, he shows how many ideas still have meaning if used in a correct way. Capitalism is about real competition. He shows how this concept can be analyzed without the concepts of optimization, representative agents, 'rational' expectations, or any of the crappy lagrangian math I hated having to 'learn' a dozen times in my university educations. He uses scary words like Marx and capital and labor. He shows how capitalism has had long Kondratiev waves, and how profits are intricately linked to them. He does not forget the human element of economics. Understanding Capitalism seems key to understanding where we are in history, and what form the future can take.
		blockquote Official unemployment measures indicate that even without adjusting for part-time and discouraged workers there are currently almost 200 million people in the world without jobs, and almost 900 million workers live in dire poverty. Even if capitalism recovers soon from the crisis, can it grow fast enough to offset the steady march of mechanization of all sorts of labor activities? Can it even absorb the new labor coming from population growth, let alone the already existing large pool? Whatever form it may take, capitalism will remain bound by the laws of real competition on which it rests.
