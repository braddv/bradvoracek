			| I was born in Lancaster, California. I moved once between 4th and 5th grade. I remember my parents worrying it would stunt me socially. I made good friends in 5th grade. Middle school sucked though. Through puberty I was bullied for being intelligent and chubby. I took all the math classes available at the public school and ended up taking geometry and algebra 2 at the local community college. This put me in trigonometry when I entered high school at LnHS. I finished AP Calculus AB with a 5 sophomore year, and then there was no math left for me there either. I no longer had time to go to the community college though. I would have to wait until Berkeley to take more math classes.

			| I didn't have time because I built and operated robots for FIRST Robotics Team 399 in the spring, and played football in the fall. I was the only big guy who got to touch the ball every play! Football was a thankless job. I didn't particulary enjoy it, but I had been playing since I was a small child. Every year since I was eight I wanted to quit. Before high school, my dad always convinced me to keep playing. In high school, my best friend Barker did the convincing. Every year for a decade, I wanted to quit, but I kept playing. By high school the hard part was over though. They needed me. Those linemen formed a community where I was wanted for being smart. I knew all the plays for all the linemen. If you ever forgot what you were supposed to do on the o-line, you just had to ask Voracek. It felt nice.

			| Robotics created another community where I felt challenged and welcome. It was a beautiful time. We traveled the country. I designed and built competitive robots. I got to think a lot. I helped produce the robot that won the teams first regional. Our team won chairmans for being active in helping our community. It was fantastic. It surely helped me get into college. Even more than the dozen AP classes I passed and having the second highest GPA in my class. I would have had the highest GPA, but I encountered my first black swan event. There was a class, senior project, that every senior was supposed to have to take. They canceled that class. There were no more AP classes for me to take, and taking a "regular" class would lower my GPA. A quirky side effect of AP classes being worth 5 in your GPA and regular classes being worth 4 is that your GPA is boosted not only by maximizing AP classes, but also by minimizing regular classes. Averages are fun. I wanted to go to Stanford, because I thought I was the best, and I thought Stanford represented the best. I ended up going to Berkeley. Second "best". Not too bad.

			| Undergrad. Ugh. In some ways I really fucked up my time there, even though I still learned a lot and had a lot of fun. Hindsight is always 20/20 I guess. I started by trying to maintain a long distance relationship with my high school girlfriend. We lasted until almost the end of freshman year, but by then the damage was done. Freshman year, in the beginning, I thought I was set. I had made it to the best public university in the country from a shitty desert suburb, I had a beautiful girlfriend who challenged me, what could go wrong? I didn't realize how important it would be to make friends that year. That wasn't something I prioritized at all. I felt like I was an overweight math nerd and I acted like it. Antisocial tendencies and all. Psh, why did other people matter? How were they going to help me? I was the best! Everyone else? Mouth breathers. Plebes. That made the breakup really hard. I hated her for a while. I ghosted the one person who I was closest to at that time in my life, and had no one else to fill the gap. How foolish :)

			| My dad was an aerospace engineer at NASA, Edwards Airforce Base, and helped me get a nice internship that first summer during college. Second semester of freshman year I took CS61A at Cal and fell in love with computing. I thought abstraction was so beautiful. That very semester I planned out the rest of my college existence. I found out I could double major if every class I took was a requirement for either math, CS, or general breadth. This seemed too perfect not to turn down. Double majoring seemed so very <i>important</i>. I took over $5000 back to Berkeley with me and opened a Roth IRA to invest it. I figured computer science was going to net me big buck$ so I better learn how to invest to <i>maximize</i> my retirement. There's that damn word again. I've done so many fucking lagrange multiplier problems they make me sick. Especially once I learned how they were used in economics. I'm getting ahead of myself...

			| Sophomore year I had a new extracurricular goal - I was going to lose weight, and meet new girls. I had to fill the void of my last girlfriend. I still barely cared about friendship, I wanted that all encompassing young love that I had before. I thought any girl should want to jump right in to having that with me. I just had to look a little prettier, get their attention, and they'd know <i>instantly</i> about how <i>smart</i> I was and I'd be set again. Now I think real relationships take a lot of time and a lot of communication, but again... I don't really know. I haven't committed myself to anyone since. I still have a lot to learn about Love. I think we all do. Anyway. When I set goals I meet them. I researched how to lose weight. What worked for me was eating more fat calories, eating less carbohydrates, and I found exercise to be inconsequential. I tracked and measured my intake and output for that entire year. At the end of sophomore year I was 50 lbs lighter and a lot stronger. Even though exercising was inconsequential for weight loss, I mean, <i>muscles</i> are nice right? All the while - I didn't really make progress on making friends or meeting girls. Maximizing (minimizing) the wrong damn thing again. I had a few really good friends that I spent my time with, and kept chugging along my 12 technical units a semester. I could have met so many more people at Cal... At graduation, knowing one row of people when there were hundreds of rows there, it didn't feel great.

			| That next summer I had a really nice fling. I looked great, I felt great, I was making good money at my new programming internship at <i>big corporation</i> Cisco, I topped off my IRA and came back to Cal thinking I now deserved the attention of everyone. I felt like a big shot. This year I would have to face reality and not the image I had built up though. Occupy Wall Street started that fall of 2011. My earlier views of what was important shifted. Now I was interested in social change and I didn't see exactly how math and computers were going to get me there. But I had already planned out my entire college curriculumn. How could I go back on my plan? It got so much harder - 12 one hundred level technical units was really different than 12 intro technical units. But how could I quit? I had told "everyone" I was <i>double majoring</i>. I changed my secondary math major to applied math in economics. There. Economics. Now I was going to make some social change. Surely, the problems we were facing were economic. The recession proved that, didn't it?

			| Depression. That word sums up most of junior year. In hindsight I can see why none of my efforts this year worked, but I didn't understand then. I smoked a lot of pot. Why wasn't I <i>cool?</i> I had a few close friends still, but most of them were from the before time. From freshman and sophomore year. We had a fantastic time together. I drank a lot. I went to frat parties, co-op parties, house parties. I still managed to pass my classes, but I wasn't getting the A's I was getting before. I didn't care. Now it was just about passing the classes. Getting the piece(s) of paper. I was still on track to double major. I was doing fine. I could fit it all in - party, classes, what else was there? I'd hook up with one of these girls and we'd fall in love. Sad, really. Both of us were inebriated. There was no way we were making a genuine connection. The morning afters we'd part ways. Awkward glances as we walked across memorial glade. No talking. No lasting connections. This year contains some of the biggest regrets of my life. Ah well. Can't change the past ;) 
		p.lead 
			| I didn't like being sad. Does anyone? I hope not. In some ways being sad was easier than fixing it though. I researched sadness. I researched depression. I could solve this. But I'd solve it in the future. Now? Naw. I'll stick to drinking and smoking. That <i>short termism</i> dominated. I can't say it was anything beyond pure luck that set me on the right path. I was at Gordo's and I saw a flyer for a talk by Paul Fleischman. It mentioned he would introduce us to a 10-day Vipassana meditation retreat. 10 days of silence. 10 days of being sober. That seemed like the way for me. I went to the talk and right afterwards signed up for the first available opening. It was at the end of the summer. That summer after junior year I also took a Buddhist Psychology class. I was introduced to meditation in a theoretical way. This was my only course that wasn't taken as a requirement for some piece of paper. I took it pass/no pass and yet that class was one of the most memorable. It was a really nice summer. I chilled really hard. I worked on an app called Politify to predict how Romney and Obama would effect household tax returns. I had a lot of fun. Then at the end of the summer, I learned how to meditate. One of the most important experiences in my life so far. I learned more in those 10 days than I did in over a decade of schooling. Not that learning is really measurable or comparable in that sort of way :) hyperbole. sue me.

			| Senior year was not too different from junior year. There was a new void to fill - what the hell am I going to do after college? That's all any adult would ask me. Classes stopped mattering even more. I still did my 12 technical units and almost finished the double major. My very last math class I tried to get a D and undershot, getting an F. It all seemed like a joke anyway. F is for Funny. All the jobs I was interviewing for (and I interviewed for a lot) had me doing stuff back from CS61B. These higher level classes, while some were very interesting, seemed to have no relevance to the next step in my life. I pushed on anyway. Fuck grit culture.

			| My very last interview, after I stopped applying, after I had given up hope, I got accepted to work for Tradeshift. In that frenzied senior year I also applied for some grad schools. Even though I was so over school, I was still pretty good at it. The devil you know is better than the one you don't, as they say. In my research on economics I had come across Wynne Godley and Hyman Minsky, and discovered both of these economists had passed away at the same place - The Levy Institute at Bard College. Both economists were very critical of the mainstream, and I was too. The lagrangians I was doing in mathematical economics had nothing to do with the social problems I saw facing America. The IS-LM curves in macroeconomics seemed similarly inconsequential. The problems the occupy movement was talking about and have continued on through Black Lives Matter were not going to be solved by a mathematical formula. These guys seemed to agree, so I decided I'd do more school. I hoped I would learn something. 
		p.lead 
			| I deffered attending grad school for a year to make some money. Tradeshift treated me very well and payed me way more than I deserved. Some days I wish I stayed working for them, when I quit I had a six figure salary. With two years of grad school costing $50k in tuition alone, the opportunity cost of me attending thus pushes over $250k. It's not about the money though. Of that I am now certain. I learned some valuable (not measurable in money terms) things in grad school, but I also had to take a lot more math and computing that I felt I already knew. Rigid one size fits all curriculms are horribly outdated. I thought a new graduate program would be different, but in the end these requirements are set by the state. There's an institution that hasn't kept up with the times. In August 2016 I finished the program, taking an extra summer to complete my thesis that was "supposed" to be done in May. I feel burned out. Yet I am the happiest I have been in a long time.
		p.lead 
			| This time after college, I am embracing the void. I continued to fit in meditation retreats in between working and grad school. The more I learn on that path the more valuable it seems than anything else I have done. I'm done with college, in debt, and most people seem to think I should be worried about making school "worth it". I should be finding a high paying job to pay back my student debt, to buy a house, to keep the capitalist system churning along. I'm not buying into it this time. I'm doing what I enjoy. I'm doing what makes me happy. I'm writing. I'm helping others. I'm serving my community. I'm building things that aren't profitable. Time is my most valuable asset, and I'm using it in the way I see as most effective. I don't think it's possible to measure this effectiveness in money terms or any terms really.
