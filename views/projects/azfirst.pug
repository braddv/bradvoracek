		h3 FIRST develops in demand skills. 
		div The top three in demand skills in 2020 will be complex problem solving, critical thinking, and creativity. FIRST requires all three of these skills. Students not only engineer robots, but they are incentivized to build community. This means students in FIRST programs will be prepared for the people skills that are growing in demand as well.

		small Jobs data is from the 2015 ACS via ipums. I use all records with statefip == Arizona. Source code to replicate these findings (or find bugs) can be found on my github #[a(href='https://github.com/braddv/bradvoracek/blob/master/azengineering.do') here]. Data from FLL is from ASU's qualifying tournament survey, self-reported by teams.
