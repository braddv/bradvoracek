		p.lead The Nix created American characters I felt deeply invested in. A mother and son with a terrible relationship. A fat and poor MMO addict. A college student who has no idea why she is there. Nathan Hill draws beautiful parallels between the 1968 protests in Chicago to the Occupy Wall Street movement in 2010. This served as a reminder for me that the Civil Rights Movement is still ongoing. The book felt very timely. He comments on the political and economic situation America finds itself in in 2016, and shows how this position plays out in the life of fictional but totally believable characters. It contains longwinded vignettes that remind me of David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest. I meet so many people whose thoughts really work like that. They talk and think in long winded sentences that really have no purpose being long winded sentences but for some reason they turn out like that because they can not simply take the time to notice that the one thing they are doing automatically all the time has changed so much and because it has been going on like that for some time they do not even realize how different it is from their resting state. Simply breathing is shown as a solution for our lack of empathy. He shows how the anxiety, depression, and feelings of isolation and loneliness felt by some Americans are connected to the capitalist system they all live in. The college girl sheds some light on how I felt in both schools I attended. This feeling that we had no clue why we were there but somehow it was <i>deeply important</i>. The commentary surrounding college strongly reminded me of William Deresiewicz' Excellent Sheep. Overall, I highly recommend this book. You'll learn something about American society, and perhaps something about yourself. 
		blockquote Maybe literally the last thing you should be doing right now is thinking. The very worst thing you could be doing right now is examining the situation and trying to decide what is <i>right</i>.... Listen, Samuel, really, voice of experience here? It's a terrible burden being idealistic. It discolors everything you'll do later. It will haunt you constantly for all time as you become the inevitably cynical person the world requires you to be. Just give up on it now, the idealism, doing the right thing. Then you'll have nothing to regret later.

		p.lead Excellent Sheep got me through my master's degree. It was my 6th year of college. I finished Berkeley, almost getting a double major, but realizing somewhere in my junior year that I really didn't care about getting both majors. I was learning less by taking so many technical classes. They overlapped so much. My goal in many classes turned into minimizing workload required to pass. I took it too far in my final math class, trying to get a D to cement my double major status, and I ended up with a big fat F, so I "only" got a math minor. I wish someone told me not to double major. I wish someone told me to take classes I was interested in. I wish someone told me not to have so much grit. Eventually someone did, but I didn't read William until I finished two more brutal years of grad school. Some of the classes in grad school were great. Those that required me to read and write. I still had to take so much math though, that my goal became the same. Do the least amount of work to pass the class. I thought I had better things to do than work my ass off on material I already knew. And perhaps I did. I made good friends. I read a lot of tangential material. I thought a lot about the college system. In the end I learned a lot. But that won't be reflected in my grades. That's ok, because I think they're a bullshit measure anyway. You'll have to decide for yourself.
